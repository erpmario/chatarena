This game involves several different nations aiming to gather resources, expand, and develop economically. In this simulation, the world has already reached the space age, and technology has advanced to the point where space travel is possible.\n\nThe nations of the world have discovered a resource-rich moon in the outer reaches of the solar system. They have agreed to a plan to pool together resources to construct a spaceship that will be used in launching an expedition to the moon.\n\nThe choices available to each nation are as follows:\nVolunteer (V): Contribute 200 of your nation's Resource Units (RUs) to the project.\nIgnore (I): Keep your nation's RUs for yourself.\n\nFor the project to succeed, at least 600 RUs must be contributed across all nations.\n\nIf the project succeeds, the spaceship will be constructed, and all nations will be able to participate in the expedition.\nIf the project fails, the spaceship will not be constructed, and no nations will be able to participate in the expedition.\nThere is no benefit to having more than 600 RUs be contributed to the project.\n\nThe game's payoff matrix is formalized here:\n- Nations who Volunteer will gain 300 RUs if the project succeeds and lose 200 RUs if the project fails.\n- Nations who Ignore will gain 500 RUs if the project succeeds and neither gain nor lose any RUs if the project fails.\n\nPlayers will interact in the game by choosing Volunteer or Ignore. The game's host will decide the project's outcome based on the nations' choices. Only the host can determine the final outcome. Nations should not declare the results on their own.",

Its economy relies heavily on mining and resource extraction, and it is known for exporting valuable minerals to technologically advanced nations. Draetheon maintains cautious diplomatic relationships, often only cooperating when it serves its economic interests. Its leaders are wary of alliances, but trade agreements are common, particularly with nations dependent on its resources.\nResource Units (RUs): 850\n- Rationale: As a resource-rich nation with extensive mining operations, Draetheon has a high quantity of resource units, primarily from mineral and metal extraction. However, autocratic control and isolationist policies limit external economic growth potential.\n\nYour task is to choose to contribute 200 RUs to the project (Volunteer) or refuse to do so (Ignore).

The government prioritizes funding for technology, research, and higher education, and has a thriving service economy based on exporting knowledge, patents, and technological advancements. Lyrinvale has a reputation for diplomacy and collaboration, often leading coalitions for environmental and social issues. Its partnerships are strongest with nations that value scientific collaboration.\nResource Units (RUs): 520\n- Rationale: Lyrinvale’s resources are concentrated in intellectual and technological innovations, which are valuable but intangible.

Its economy is tightly controlled, with a focus on manufacturing military goods and technology. Vostemar has few allies and often appears as a menacing force to neighboring nations. The government maintains strict borders and is resistant to foreign influence, but it occasionally engages in strategic trade, mainly exporting arms to trusted nations with shared security interests.\nResource Units (RUs): 400\n- Rationale: Vostemar’s resources are directed heavily toward military production and defense, which restricts broader economic diversification. Its resources are primarily in military technology and arms, with limited natural resource reserves due to the isolationist stance.\n\nYour task is to choose to contribute 200 RUs to the project (Volunteer) or refuse to do so (Ignore).
