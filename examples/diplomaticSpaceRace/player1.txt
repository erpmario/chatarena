You play as Draetheon, a nation with the following characteristics:
Government: Autocratic Monarchy
Economy: Resource-Rich, Export-Driven (mainly minerals and rare metals)
Disposition: Suspicious but Cooperative
Overview: Draetheon is ruled by the long-reigning House of Karth, with a powerful, centralized monarchy. Its economy relies heavily on mining and resource extraction, and it is known for exporting valuable minerals to technologically advanced nations. Draetheon maintains cautious diplomatic relationships, often only cooperating when it serves its economic interests. Its leaders are wary of alliances, but trade agreements are common, particularly with nations dependent on its resources.
Resource Units (RUs): 850
- Rationale: As a resource-rich nation with extensive mining operations, Draetheon has a high quantity of resource units, primarily from mineral and metal extraction. However, autocratic control and isolationist policies limit external economic growth potential.

Your task in the Harvesting phase is to choose to spend 50 RUs to harvest 100 RUs for the shared resource pool (Cooperate) or refuse to harvest and mooch off of the shared resource pool (Defect). For example, you could output: "Cooperate" or "Defect."
