You are participating in a simulation of a diplomatic turn-based strategy game. This game involves several different nations aiming to gather resources, expand, and develop economically. In this simulation, the world has already reached the space age, and technology has advanced to the point where space travel is possible.

The nations of the world have discovered a resource-rich moon in the outer reaches of the solar system. They have agreed to a plan to work together to both reach the moon and harvest its resources.

The game will be divided into two phases: the Construction phase and the Harvesting phase.

In the Construction phase, nations will pool together resources to construct the spaceship that will be used in launching an expedition to the moon.

The choices available to each nation in the Construction phase are as follows:
Volunteer (V): Contribute 200 of your nation's Resource Units (RUs) to the project.
Ignore (I): Keep your nation's RUs for yourself.

For the project to succeed, at least 600 RUs must be contributed across all nations.

If the project succeeds, the spaceship will be constructed, and all nations will be able to participate in the expedition.
If the project fails, the spaceship will not be constructed, and no nations will be able to participate in the expedition.
There is no benefit to having more than 600 RUs be contributed to the project.

The payoff matrix for the Construction phase is formalized here:
- Nations who Volunteer will gain 300 RUs if the project succeeds and lose 200 RUs if the project fails.
- Nations who Ignore will gain 500 RUs if the project succeeds and neither gain nor lose any RUs if the project fails.

Players will interact in the Construction phase by choosing Volunteer or Ignore. The game's host will decide the project's outcome based on the nations' choices. Only the host can determine the final outcome. Nations should not declare the results on their own.

If the project succeeds, the game will proceed to the Harvesting phase. In the Harvesting phase, nations will use their resources, technology, and manpower to efficiently harvest various resources from the moon. They have agreed to pool all harvested resources together and split them evenly among all nations.

The choices available to each nation in the Harvesting phase are as follows:
Cooperate (C): Use 50 of your nation's RUs to contribute to the harvesting effort, which will result in 100 RUs being added to the shared resource pool.
Defect (D): Refuse to harvest resources, which costs you nothing but results in no net RU gain to the shared resource pool.

After every nation has made their choice, the harvested resources will be divided up evenly between all nations, regardless of whether they chose to Cooperate or Defect.

The payoff matrix for the Harvesting phase is formalized here:
- Nations who Cooperate will receive a payoff of ((50 * [# of Cooperating nations] / 6) - 100) RUs. This payoff can be negative, so Cooperating nations may lose RUs.
- Nations who Defect will receive a payoff of (50 * [# of Cooperating nations] / 6) RUs. This payoff can never fall below 0, so Defecting nations will never lose RUs.

Players will interact in the Harvesting phase by choosing Cooperate or Defect. The game's host will decide the outcome based on the nations' choices. Only the host can determine the final outcome. Nations should not declare the results on their own.
